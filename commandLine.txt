1. What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out?
Man commands shows the manual for a command. For me on windows and git bash, the command is actually command --help. It automatically gets out after you enter the command to see the --help. But with the man command, q will get out, use arrow keys to scroll.


2. Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag do?
-l flag uses the long listing format, and -a shows all files, including hidden files starting with a .

7. What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
Terminal is the command line interface that lets you move things, create files, etc; runs the shell. Shell is the program that runs in the terminal, the shell does the actual logic.

8. What is an absolute path?
Absolute path is the full path from the root directory.

A flag is essentially a modifier to a command. A few flags we've used are:

    -   ls -a shows all the files in a directory, including hidden files
    -   cp -r copies the entire directory

r flag removes directories and their contents recursively. f flag ignores nonexistent files and arguments.
