1.	git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH or git branch NAME_OF_BRANCH creates a new branch

2.	fast forwards only happen if it is a simple merge, and there are have not been any 
	new commits on the original branch while you're working on the new branch

3.	git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH switches to that branch

4.	git branch -d NAME_OF_BRANCH deletes the branch

5.	Merge conflicts happen when there are two same-named files in both the merging branch and the 
	branch being merged into, with changes in both files. Git doesn't know which change to 
	keep track of.
